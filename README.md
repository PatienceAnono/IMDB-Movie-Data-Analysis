1. INTRODUCTION<br>

In this project,Microsoft was launching a new movie studio and i had to make recommendations to the stake holders.
I had to find out what types of films are doing best in the current market at the moment and present the findings to the Microsoft executives.I used exploratory data analysis to generate insights for the business.To get started, I was given the following sets of data obtained from the following sources:
Box Office Mojo.
IMDB.
Rotten Tomatoes.
TheMovieDB.
The Numbers.

I was assigned with the following tasks:
Explore the given data and/or find complementary data
Obtain meaningful, actionable insights from it that will
Help the new head of the studio decide What type of films to create.


2. BUSINESS PROBLEM<br>

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies.After my survey,i found a lot of information on individual movies.There are countless factors at play in creating original video content for a movie studio, from determining production costs to developing targeted marketing campaigns.

2.1 Objectives<br>
As a consultant, i decided to focus my analysis on:
1.High level recommendation on genres because once the studio understood what sort of films they wanted to make,they would make better decisons.
2.The most lucrative time to release the movies.
3.The production budget to achieve the highest likely returns on investment.
4.The type of films  that are currently doing the best at the box office.
5.What  people like.
6.How much does it costs to make each type of movie.
8.How much money they are making.

3. DATA UNDERSTANDING<br>
With a seemingly endless array of movies and television shows for users to choose from, retaining viewers is of paramount importance to streaming services and film production companies.If viewer recommendations are not accurate,this could lead to that viewer turning to watch other things.


4. DATA PREPARATION<br>
I utilized different sources for my analysis such as Inspecting all of the data sets provided using python and pandas library, storing and cleaning the data in a pandas dataframe and visualization of data using seaborn and matplotlib.Idecided to focus more on the genre and finances.
